     <h1>History of Python</h1>
     <p>Python, developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands, is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms and contains a comprehensive standard library. </p>

    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <p>Python offers two primary loop structures: for loops and while loops, each serving distinct purposes in controlling the flow of execution. </p>
    <h3>For Loops</h3>
    <p>Designed for iterating over a sequence (like lists, tuples, strings, or ranges) or other iterable objects. The number of iterations is typically known in advance, as it's determined by the length of the sequence being traversed. Useful when you need to perform an action for each element in a collection. </p>
    <h3> While Loops</h3>
<p>Repeat a block of code as long as a given condition remains true. The number of iterations isn't predetermined, as it depends on the condition becoming false. Suitable when the loop needs to continue until a specific situation is met.</p>
