     <h1>History of Racket</h1>
        <p>Racket is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. The Racket language is a modern dialect of Lisp and a descendant of Scheme. It is designed as a platform for programming language design and implementation. (credits to wikipedia)</p>

    <h1>Basic Racket Functions</h1>
    <p>In DrRacket, math functions follow prefix notation, meaning the operator comes before the operands. For basic arithmetic, expressions like (+ 3 4), (- 10 2), (\* 6 5), and (/ 20 4) evaluate to 7, 8, 30, and 5 respectively. More advanced functions are also built-in. You can calculate square roots with (sqrt 9), exponents with (expt 2 3) for 2 to the power of 3, absolute values using (abs -7), and use (modulo 10 3) or (remainder 10 3) for modulus operations. </p>
<br>
<p>Trigonometric functions use radians by default. For example, (sin 0) returns 0, (cos 0) returns 1, and (tan 0) returns 0. Inverse trig functions like (asin 1) and (atan 1) return pi divided by 2 and pi divided by 4 respectively. To work with logarithms, (log 10) gives the natural log of 10, while (log10 1000) returns the base-10 log (3.0). The exponential function (exp 1) returns e to the power of 1, approximately 2.718.</p>
