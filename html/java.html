      <h1>History of Java</h1>
      <p>Java, developed at Sun Microsystems, Inc. by a team lead by James Gosling between 1991 and 1995, is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.
